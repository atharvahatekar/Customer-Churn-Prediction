<h1>Customer Churn Rate Prediction</h1>
1. Churn rate is a critical metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rates mean happy customers; high churn rates mean customers are leaving you.<br>
2. Churn tells you how many existing customers are leaving your business, so lowering churn has a big positive impact on your revenue streams.<br>
3. Churn is a good indicator of growth potential. Churn rates track lost customers, and growth rates track new customersâ€”comparing and analyzing 
both of these metrics tells you exactly how much your business is growing over time. If growth is higher than churn, you can say your business is growing. 
If churn is higher than growth, your business is getting smaller. <br>
